The solution is then plotted on the webpage using  plotly.js . \n \n \n This code defines a function dy_dx that represents the mass-spring-damper system with a PID controller. The gains of the PID controller are set to Kp = 10.0, Ki = 1.0, and Kd = 0.5. The Euler method is used to solve this system of equations for a range of x values from 0 to 20 with initial conditions of y0 = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. The response of the system is then plotted on the webpage using  plotly.js . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n STL part viewer \n \n \n Using  sine-cosine algorithm  to optimize with constraints in Brython: \n <!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brython@3/dist/brython_stdlib"></script>\n</head>\n<body onload="brython()">\n\n<div id="output"></div>\n\n<script type="text/python">\nfrom browser import document\nfrom random import random, uniform\nfrom math import sin, cos, pi\n\n# Define the objective function\ndef objective_function(x):\n    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2\n\n# Define the constraint functions\ndef constraint1(x):\n    return x[0] + x[1] -
